# Relational-Databases

I've uploaded a pdf document of the diagram I created, I used a site called dbdiagram.io to create the diagram, made the whole process a  lot simpler.

Also, I forgot to save my most recent db file, the one you're seeing is from yesterday before I had decided to scrap it and start planning.
